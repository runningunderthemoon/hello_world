today is august twenty-three 2015,I am very happy.
I am 24.
if use chiness to say that ,ithis year is my year.
I am a ordinary chinese man.
once I have a account of the github when I was a student,but I forget it.
so I had to create a new one
one thing made me feel ashamed of is which I have learned english more than ten years,but still has been very bad.
I have a dream when I was young,when I grow up I can go to the best universities in the world to see and to learn.
but it can not be true until today.
so I will make a plan to make it come true.
I hope anyone else who will give some suggests and I will work harder everyday.
my heart has been full of yearing for Massachusetts institute of technology,I love this university so much.
I like computer very much and I am interested in the operating system so I hope I can go there to study it.
